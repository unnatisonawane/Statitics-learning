    "#### 1. One-Way ANOVA:\n",
    "    1. Situation: One-Way ANOVA is used when you have one factor with two or more levels and you want to compare the means of a continuous dependent variable across those groups.\n",
    "    2. Example: Comparing the average test scores of students across different grade levels (e.g., 9th grade, 10th grade, 11th grade, and 12th grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Two-Way ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Situation: Two-Way ANOVA is used when you have two factors and one continuous dependent variable. It allows you to examine the main effects of each independent variable and their interaction effect on the dependent variable.\n",
    "    2. Example: Investigating the effect of both gender (male vs. female) and treatment (drug A vs. drug B) on blood pressure levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Three-Way ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Situation: Three-Way ANOVA is used when you have three categorical independent variables (factors) and one continuous dependent variable. It allows you to examine the main effects of each independent variable, as well as their interactions.\n",
    "    2. Example: Analyzing the impact of factors like temperature (low, medium, high), humidity (low, medium, high), and time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) on crop yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Repeated Measure ANOVA\n",
    "    1. One factor with at least two levels, levels are dependent.\n",
    "    2. also known as within-subjects ANOVA, is used when the same subjects are measured under different conditions or at different time points.\n",
    "    3. Example :\n",
    "    Suppose a researcher wants to study the effect of different training interventions on the running speed of athletes hree consecutive days.For each day, the running speed of each athlete is recorded.\n",
    "    By utilizing a repeated measures design, the researcher can assess the changes in running speed within each athlete across the three consecutive days, taking into account their individual performance and potential improvements resulting from the different training interventions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 4. Factorial ANOVA\n",
    "    1. Two or more factors( each of which with atleast) 2 levels, levels can be independdent and dependent.\n",
    "    2. Factorial ANOVA is used when there are two or more independent variables (factors) that are studied simultaneously to determine their effects on the dependent variable.\n",

Within-Group Variation: Also known as the residual or error variation, this component represents the variation in the dependent variable that cannot be explained by the independent variable.
